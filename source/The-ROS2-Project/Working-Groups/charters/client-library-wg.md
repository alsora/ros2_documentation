# ROS 2 Client Library Working Group

## Name

ROS 2 Client Library Working Group


## Chair

The chair of the working group shall be Alberto Soragna.


## Purpose

The working group shall facilitate contributions to the ROS 2 client library-related repositories.
Example activities are: design of new features, discussion and triage of tickets, resolution of controversial changes and requests, and more.

The working group oversees the official ROS 2 client library interfaces (rclcpp and rclpy as of this writing) and the common ROS 2 client library, rcl.
Community-supported client library interfaces fall outside the working groupâ€™s responsibility, but community members interested in them are welcome to attend meetings for support and guidance.


## Tasks

The Working Group shall perform the following tasks.

1. Review open pull requests to client library repositories.
1. Provide guidance to new developers on how to contribute to Client Library repositories.
1. Discuss problems related to client libraries, and possible solutions.
1. Design improvements and new features related to client library repositories.


## Expected outputs

The Working Group shall, upon completion of its tasks and as appropriate while performing them, provide to the ROS PMC the following.

1. A monthly report to the ROS PMC on what the activities of the Working Group was.
1. At the end date, a list of pull requests and issues discussed by or resolved by the Working Group.


## Completion date

This Working Group doesn't have a set completion date, but it will be reviewed and renewed as appropriate yearly by the ROS PMC at the first ROS PMC meeting of the calendar year (generally in early January).


## Meetings

The working group will usually meet every two weeks, on Friday at 8AM PST.
Meetings could be cancelled if there are no new topics to discuss or could happen more frequently around key dates (such as when a new ROS 2 distribution is released).
Meeting reminders will be posted a few days in advance via Discourse and Google Group.
Meeting minutes will be posted on Discourse after every meeting.
